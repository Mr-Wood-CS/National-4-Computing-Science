# Normal, Extreme and Exceptional Test Data

When we test a program, we use test data. You enter the test data as the inputs to the program. The data should try to capture a range of different scenarios - don’t just test the program with one piece of data.

As an example:

You are asked to write a program that picks a random number. The user has to guess what number the program has picked. They are asked to enter a number between 0 and 10. If they enter a number outside that range, the program should show an error message.

There are three types of data you need to be able to use and give examples of: normal, extreme and exceptional. In this example, the program expects a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive).

We write this data into a test table. 

The test table shows the data we test the program with. 

We put one example in each row of the table (i.e. don’t say “anything between 1 and 9” - pick one!)

In the test table, you should say what you expect the program to do. Some test tables have another column for what actually happened, and you would record this afterwards.

Take another example - rolling a dice. 

You are asked for four pieces of test data: one normal, two extreme and one exceptional. 

Remember that normal data is definitely within range, extreme is on the edge, but accepted, and exceptional is definitely incorrect. 

Which values would be valid for a standard 6-sided dice?
